Simulates FCFS and SSTF disk scheduling algorithms. See the attached file.

Project Description
In this project, you will write a program called disksched, which simulates FCFS and SSTF disk
scheduling algorithms. The program will be invoked as follows:
./disksched <inputfile> <outputfile> <algorithm> [limit]
• <inputfile> is the name of a text file including the information about the disk requests to be
scheduled. Each line of the input file will include information about a different disk request and it
will have the following format:
<arrival-time> <LBN> <request-size>
For example, the following can be a sample input file:
0.011413 657728 16
0.011565 31244784 64
0.011721 21868784 16
0.016187 34567136 64
0.018256 11813968 32
0.020103 32234560 16
Each line of the input file represents a different request, starts without any space, ends with a
newline, and there is a single space (' ') in between each field in a line. Note that the example input
file provided above is just provided for illustration purposes. Your program will be tested using
input files containing much larger number of requests. Here is more information about the content
of the input file:
– All three fields are guaranteed to appear in the input file
– <arrival-time> is a positive real number in seconds
– <LBN> stands for the Logical Block Number and it is a positive integer representing the
starting location of the disk request
– <request-size> is a positive integer describing the number of sectors to be transferred
– Requests are sorted by their arrival times in increasing order
– Requests have different arrival times
